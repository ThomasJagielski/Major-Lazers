                  During this sprint we were focused on developing a proof of concept of our systems.  Within this, we ensured we could detect a laser using the photodiode.  We found we needed to use some sort of filter on the diode to ensure we were isolating for the color wavelengths our laser was.  We used a red expo marker to cover the photodiode.  The second thing we worked on was outputting tones to a speaker through the Arduino.  We used Arduino’s tone function to do this.  Our final test for this sprint was integrating the photodiode with the speaker.  We successfully were able to play a tone through the speaker when the photodiode was detected.

                  We got a lot of input and advice about the software vs electrical audio. More than the majority of the survey takers said we needed to flesh out the software side of this project with mechanical system being our second priority.

                        For this sprint, we put together the whole structure with the lasers and electrical system the night before and took a video for the sprint review. In the sprint, we were able to (mostly) meet our mvp and be able to play notes after the user input. After we presented our sprint review, we seemed to not have explained the overall system super well and had a few questions regarding that. We received some feedback on overall concerns about our project. One of the main topics was the size of the circuit we’re dealing with and fitting that into our system. Additionally, many were impressed by what we accomplished on the electrical side.

                        Kyle, our saviour, told us about how we can set where the voltage goes and pass through each laser individually and fast enough so that it looks like all of them are on. Stan also told us the lasers need a resistor in series and that we need to measure the current across the laser.
